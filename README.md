Assignment Overview
This repository contains the implementation for Home Assignment 1 in CS5720 at the University of Central Missouri. The assignment covers foundational concepts in deep learning using TensorFlow and includes the following tasks:



Tasks have been split up by the 4 major sections.

Tasks and Descriptions
1. Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping
Create and manipulate tensors using TensorFlow.
Perform reshaping, transposing, and broadcasting.
Learn and explain TensorFlow’s broadcasting rules.

2. Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning
Compute and compare Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE).
Analyze how small changes in predictions affect loss.
Visualize loss comparisons using Matplotlib.

3. Train a Model with Different Optimizers
Train MNIST digit classifier using Adam and SGD optimizers.
Plot and compare training and validation accuracy.

4. TensorBoard Logging
Train a simple neural network with TensorBoard logging enabled.
Visualize training metrics using TensorBoard.
Analyze loss and accuracy trends.



How to Run
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
